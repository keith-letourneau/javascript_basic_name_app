    <p id="string"> Why this sudden bewilderment, this confusion?
      (How serious people’s faces have become.)
      Why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly,
      everyone going home lost in thought?
      <br><br>
      Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come.
      And some of our men just in from the border say
      there are no barbarians any longer.
      <br><br>
      Now what’s going to happen to us without barbarians?
      Those people were a kind of solution.</p>
